# Particle Filter Algorithm

Welcome to the Particle Filter Algorithm directory within the Localization section of the Robot Navigation Algorithm repository! ü§ñ Here, we delve into the principles and workings of the Particle Filter algorithm, a powerful tool for estimating the state of a dynamic system.

## Principle of the Particle Filter Algorithm

Particle Filter, often referred to as a Monte Carlo Localization method, describes the probability distribution of a non-linear system using entities known as 'Particles.' These particles represent the entire system's probability distribution and state.

### The system evolves through two main processes

**Prediction:**
1. Initialization: Start by initializing a predefined number of particles, denoted as N.
2. System Model: Utilize the system model to predict the next state of each particle, incorporating a non-Gaussian random variable.

**Estimation:**
1. Weight Update: Update the weight of each particle based on the difference between the measured value and the predicted value for each particle.
2. Normalization: Normalize the weights to ensure they fall between 0 and 1.

**Resampling:**
1. Resample particles based on their weights. Particles with higher weights are more likely to be replicated in the resampling process.
2. Normalize the weights of the resampled particles to maintain consistency.

**Estimation (Final):**
1. Compute the estimated state by considering the weighted sum of the resampled particles.

## Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter Collaboration

### PF_EKF_Collaboration.py

Welcome to the collaborative analysis script that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of the Particle Filter (PF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within the Robot Navigation Algorithm repository! üöÄ This script, `PF_EKF_Collaboration.py`, provides a platform to compare and contrast the outcomes of both filters, offering insights into their performance under various conditions.

### Purpose:

- **Comparison of PF and EKF:**
  - This script is designed to run both the Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter on a given dataset or scenario.
  - Enables a direct comparison of the results obtained from PF and EKF in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency.

### How to Use:

1. **Open the Script:**
   - Navigate to the `PF_EKF_Collaboration.py` file.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to initiate the simultaneous execution of PF and EKF.

3. **Observe Results:**
   - Analyze the output generated by both filters.
   - Compare and contrast the localization outcomes, computation times, and any other relevant metrics.

4. **Experimentation:**
   - Feel free to modify the script parameters, dataset, or input conditions to observe the filters' behavior under different settings.
