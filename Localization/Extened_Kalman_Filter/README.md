# Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Algorithm

Welcome to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Algorithm directory within the Localization section of the Robot Navigation Algorithm repository!     
In this section, we explore the principles and application of the EKF, a variant of the Kalman Filter designed for non-linear systems.üåê

## Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a powerful tool for state estimation in non-linear systems.    
Unlike the traditional Kalman Filter, which is suitable for linear dynamic systems, the EKF excels in scenarios where the underlying system dynamics are non-linear.   
It achieves this by employing linearization techniques to iteratively perform prediction and update steps.

### Key Steps in EKF

1. **Prediction:**
    - The EKF predicts the next state based on the current estimated state, incorporating non-linearities in the system model.
  
2. **Update:**
    - The update step adjusts the predicted state using measurement information, resulting in a more accurate estimation.
  
3. **Linearization:**
    - Linearization is a crucial aspect of EKF, where the non-linear system model is approximated with a linear model at each iteration.
  
4. **Applications:**
    - EKF finds applications in various fields, including control systems, robotics, and signal processing. It particularly shines in solving state estimation problems in non-linear dynamic systems.

## Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter Collaboration

### PF_EKF_Collaboration.py

Welcome to the collaborative analysis script that allows for the simultaneous evaluation of the Particle Filter (PF) and Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) within the Robot Navigation Algorithm repository! üöÄ This script, `PF_EKF_Collaboration.py`, provides a platform to compare and contrast the outcomes of both filters, offering insights into their performance under various conditions.

### Purpose:

- **Comparison of PF and EKF:**
  - This script is designed to run both the Particle Filter and Extended Kalman Filter on a given dataset or scenario.
  - Enables a direct comparison of the results obtained from PF and EKF in terms of localization accuracy and computational efficiency.

### How to Use:

1. **Open the Script:**
   - Navigate to the `PF_EKF_Collaboration.py` file.

2. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script to initiate the simultaneous execution of PF and EKF.

3. **Observe Results:**
   - Analyze the output generated by both filters.
   - Compare and contrast the localization outcomes, computation times, and any other relevant metrics.

4. **Experimentation:**
   - Feel free to modify the script parameters, dataset, or input conditions to observe the filters' behavior under different settings.
