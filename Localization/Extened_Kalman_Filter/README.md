# Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Algorithm

Welcome to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) Algorithm directory within the Localization section of the Robot Navigation Algorithm repository!     
In this section, we explore the principles and application of the EKF, a variant of the Kalman Filter designed for non-linear systems.üåê

## Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is a powerful tool for state estimation in non-linear systems.    
Unlike the traditional Kalman Filter, which is suitable for linear dynamic systems, the EKF excels in scenarios where the underlying system dynamics are non-linear.   
It achieves this by employing linearization techniques to iteratively perform prediction and update steps.

### Key Steps in EKF

1. **Prediction:**
    - The EKF predicts the next state based on the current estimated state, incorporating non-linearities in the system model.
  
2. **Update:**
    - The update step adjusts the predicted state using measurement information, resulting in a more accurate estimation.
  
3. **Linearization:**
    - Linearization is a crucial aspect of EKF, where the non-linear system model is approximated with a linear model at each iteration.
  
4. **Applications:**
    - EKF finds applications in various fields, including control systems, robotics, and signal processing. It particularly shines in solving state estimation problems in non-linear dynamic systems.
